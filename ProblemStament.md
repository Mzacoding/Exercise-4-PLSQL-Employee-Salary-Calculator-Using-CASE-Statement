This PL/SQL program calculates an employee's gross salary, tax payable, and net salary based on the number of hours worked and the hourly rate. The program uses a CASE statement to determine the gross salary based on the following rules:

- Regular rate for the first 40 hours
- Time and a half for each hour between 40-50 hours
- Twice the regular rate for each hour over 50 hours

The program also calculates tax payable based on a given tax rate and displays the employee's net salary
